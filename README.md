# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Racism Lore Wiki

Hello!
Welcome to my fictional lore wiki! This is just an experiment so that I can learn Git and GitHub, but it doubles as a universe where I can add lore.
It's called racism lore because the factions are separated by (or started by) colors. Me and my friends wanted to colaborate and make stories in one universe so I made this!
Anyways, if you want to add lore, feel free to do so. There is no single color, and no color is defined by a single thing. There are many shades per color, each with their own style and powers.
